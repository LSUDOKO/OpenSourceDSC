## Migrating to Tailwind CSS

We are gradually migrating the website from traditional CSS to Tailwind CSS. This improves maintainability and provides a more consistent design system.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build Tailwind CSS:
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./css/tailwind.css -o ./css/styles.tailwind.css
```

3. For development with auto-refresh:
```bash
npm run watch:css
```

### Migration Progress

- [x] Layout CSS (layout.css) - Migrated to Tailwind
- [ ] Styles CSS (styles.css) - To be migrated
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout - Improved
- [ ] Dark mode - To be implemented with Tailwind

### File Structure

- `css/tailwind.css` - Tailwind directives
- `css/styles.tailwind.css` - Generated Tailwind output
- `css/styles.css` - Original styles (to be migrated)

### Contributing

When contributing to this project, please create a new branch for each CSS file you're migrating to Tailwind.
